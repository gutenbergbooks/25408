    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      FANCHON went early one morning, like Little Red Riding-Hood, to see her
      grandmother, who lives right at the other end of the village. But Fanchon
      did not stop like little Red Riding-Hood, to gather nuts in the wood. She
      went straight on her way and she did not meet the wolf. From a long way
      off she saw her grandmother sitting on the stone step at her cottage door,
      a smile on her toothless mouth and her arms, as dry and knotty as an old
      vine-stock, open to welcome her little granddaughter. It rejoices
      Fanchon&rsquo;s heart to spend a whole day with her grandmother; and her
      grandmother, whose trials and troubles are all over and who lives as happy
      as a cricket in the warm chimney-corner, is rejoiced too to see her son&rsquo;s
      little girl, the picture of her own childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have many things to tell each other, for one of them is coming back
      from the journey of life which the other is setting out on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You grow a bigger girl every day,&rdquo; says the old grandmother to Fanchon,
      &ldquo;and every day I get smaller; I scarcely need now to stoop at all to touch
      your forehead. What matters my great age when I can see the roses of my
      girlhood blooming again in your cheeks, my pretty Fanchon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fanchon asked to be told again&mdash;for the hundredth time&mdash;all
      about the glittering paper flowers under the glass shade, the coloured
      pictures where our Generals in brilliant uniforms are overthrowing their
      enemies, the gilt cups, some of which have lost their handles, while
      others have kept theirs, and grandfather&rsquo;s gun that hangs above the
      chimney-piece from the nail where he put it up himself for the last time,
      thirty years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time flies, and the hour is come to get ready the midday dinner.
      Fanchon&rsquo;s grandmother stirs up the drowsy fire; then she breaks the eggs
      on the black earthenware platter. Fanchon is deeply interested in the
      bacon omelette as she watches it browning and sputtering over the fire.
      There is no one in the world like her grandmother for making omelettes and
      telling pretty stories. Fanchon sits on the settle, her chin on a level
      with the table, to eat the steaming omelette and drink the sparkling
      cider. But her grandmother eats her dinner, from force of habit, standing
      at the fireside. She holds her knife in her right hand, and in the other a
      crust of bread with her toothsome morsel on it. When both have done
      eating:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; says Fanchon, &ldquo;tell me the &lsquo;Blue Bird.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her grandmother tells Fanchon how, by the spite of a bad fairy, a
      beautiful Prince was changed into a sky-blue bird, and of the grief the
      Princess felt when she heard of the transformation and saw her love fly
      all bleeding to the window of the Tower where she was shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanchon thinks and thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; she says at last, &ldquo;is it a great while ago the Blue Bird
      flew to the Tower where the Princess was shut up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grandmother tells her it was many a long day since, in the times when
      the animals used to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were young then?&rdquo; asks Fanchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not yet born,&rdquo; the old woman tells her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Fanchon says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, grandmother, there were things in the world even before you were
      born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when their talk is done, her grandmother gives Fanchon an apple with a
      hunch of bread and bids her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away, little one; go and play and eat your apple in the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Fanchon goes into the garden, where there are trees and grass and
      flowers and birds.

    <p>
      HER grandmother&rsquo;s garden was full of grass and flowers and trees, and
      Fanchon thought it was the prettiest garden in all the world. By this time
      she had pulled out her pocket-knife to cut her bread with, as they do in
      the village. First she munched her apple, then she began upon her bread.
      Presently a little bird came fluttering past her. Then a second came, and
      a third. Soon ten, twenty, thirty were crowding round Fanchon. There were
      grey birds, and red, there were yellow birds, and green, and blue. And all
      were pretty and they all sang. At first Fanchon could not think what they
      wanted. But she soon saw they were asking for bread and that they were
      little beggars. Yes, they were beggars, but they were singers as well.
      Fanchon was too kind-hearted to refuse bread to any one who paid for it
      with songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a little country girl, and she did not know that once long ago, in
      a country where white cliffs of marble are washed by the blue sea, a blind
      old man earned his daily bread by singing the shepherds&rsquo; songs which the
      learned still admire to-day. But her heart laughed to hear the little
      birds, and she tossed them crumbs that never reached the ground, for the
      birds always caught them in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanchon saw that the birds were not all the same in character. Some would
      stand in a ring round her feet waiting for the crumbs to fall into their
      beaks. These were philosophers. Others again she could see circling nimbly
      on the wing all about her. She even noticed one little thief that darted
      in and pecked shamelessly at her own slice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke the bread and threw crumbs to them all; but all could not get
      some to eat. Fanchon found that the boldest and cleverest left nothing for
      the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not fair,&rdquo; she told them; &ldquo;each of you ought to take his proper
      turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they never heeded; nobody ever does, when you talk of fairness and
      justice. She tried every way to favour the weak and hearten the timid; but
      she could make nothing of it, and do what she would, she fed the big fat
      birds at the expense of the thin ones. This made her sorry; she was such a
      simple child she did not know it is the way of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crumb by crumb, the bread all went down the little singers&rsquo; throats. And
      Fanchon went back very happy to her grandmother&rsquo;s house.

    <p>
      WHEN night fell, her grandmother took the basket in which Fanchon had
      brought her a cake, filled it with apples and grapes, hung it on the
      child&rsquo;s arm, and said: &ldquo;Now, Fanchon, go straight back home, without
      stopping to play with the village ragamuffins. Be a good girl always.
      Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she kissed her. But Fanchon stood thinking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandmother?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What is it, little Fanchon?&rdquo; &ldquo;I should like to
      know,&rdquo; said Fanchon, &ldquo;if there are any beautiful Princes among the birds
      that ate up my bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that there are no more fairies,&rdquo; her grandmother told her, &ldquo;the birds
      are all birds and nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Fanchon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Fanchon set off across the meadows for her home, the chimneys of which
      she could see smoking a long way off against the red sky of sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the road she met Antoine, the gardener&rsquo;s little boy. He asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come and play with me, Fanchon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop to play with you, because my grandmother told me not to. But
      I will give you an apple, because I love you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antoine took the apple and kissed the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      They loved each other fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called her his little wife, and she called him her little husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went on her way, stepping soberly along like a staid, grown-up
      person, she heard behind her a merry twittering of birds, and turning
      round to look, she saw they were the same little pensioners she had fed
      when they were hungry. They came flying after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, little friends,&rdquo; she called to them, &ldquo;good night! It&rsquo;s
      bedtime now, so good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the winged songsters answered her with little cries that mean &ldquo;God
      keep you!&rdquo; in bird language.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Fanchon came back to her mother&rsquo;s to the sound of sweet music in the
      air.

      FANCHON lay down in the dark in her little bed, which a carpenter in the
      village had made long ago of walnut-wood and carved a light railing
      alongside. The good old man had been resting years and years now under the
      shadow of the church, in a grass-grown bed; for Fanchon&rsquo;s cot had been her
      grandfather&rsquo;s when he was a little lad, and he had slept where she sleeps
      now. A curtain of pink-sprigged cotton protects her slumbers; she sleeps,
      and in her dreams she sees the Blue Bird flying to his sweetheart&rsquo;s
      Castle. She thinks he is as beautiful as a star, but she never expects him
      to come and light on her shoulder. She knows <i>she</i> is not a Princess,
      and no Prince changed into a blue bird will come to visit her. She tells
      herself that all birds are not Princes; that the birds of her village are
      villagers, and that there might be one perhaps found amongst them, a
      little country lad changed into a sparrow by a bad fairy and wearing in
      his heart under his brown feathers the love of little Fanchon. Yes, if <i>he</i>
      came and she knew him, she would give him not bread crumbs only, but cake
      and kisses. She would so like to see him, and lo! she sees him; he comes
      and perches on her shoulder. He is a jack-sparrow, only a common sparrow.
      He has nothing rich or rare about him, but he looks alert and lively. To
      tell the truth, he is a little torn and tattered; he lacks a feather in
      his tail; he has lost it in battle&mdash;unless it was through some bad
      fairy of the village. Fanchon has her suspicions he is a naughty bird. But
      she is a girl, and she does not mind her jack-sparrow being a trifle
      headstrong, if only he has a kind heart. She pets him and calls him pretty
      names. Suddenly he begins to grow bigger; his body gets longer; his wings
      turn into two arms; he is a boy, and Fanchon knows who he is&mdash;Antoine,
      the gardener&rsquo;s little lad, who asks her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go and play together, shall we, Fanchon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She claps her hands for joy, and away she goes.... But suddenly she wakes
      and rubs her eyes. Her sparrow is gone, and so is Antoine! She is all
      alone in her little room. The dawn, peeping in between the flowered
      curtains, throws a white, innocent light over her cot. She can hear the
      birds singing in the garden. She jumps out of bed in her little nightgown
      and opens the window; she looks out into the garden, which is gay with
      flowers&mdash;roses, geraniums, and convolvulus&mdash;and spies her little
      pensioners, her little musicians, of yesterday. There they all sit in a
      row on the garden-fence, singing her a morning hymn to pay her for their
      crumbs of bread.

      THE FANCY-DRESS BALL

      HERE we have little boys who are conquering heroes and little girls who
      are heroines. Here we have shepherdesses in hoops and wreaths of roses and
      shepherds in satin coats, who carry crooks tied with knots of riband. Oh!
      what white, pretty sheep they must be these shepherds tend! Here are
      Alexander the Great and Zaire, and Pyrrhus and Merope, Mahomet, Harlequin,
      Pierrot, Scapin, Blaise and Babette. They have come from all parts, from
      Greece and Rome and the lands of Faëry, to dance together. What a fine
      thing a fancy ball is, and how delicious to be a great King for an hour or
      a famous Princess! There is nothing to spoil the pleasure. No need to act
      up to your costume, nor even to talk in character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be poor fun, mind you, to wear heroes&rsquo; clothes if you had to have
      a hero&rsquo;s heart as well. Heroes&rsquo; hearts are torn with all sorts of sorrows.
      They are most of them famous for their calamities. If they had lived
      happy, we should never have heard of them. Merope had no wish to dance.
      Pyrrhus was cruelly slain by Orestes just when he was going to wed, and
      the innocent Zaire perished by the hand of her lover the Turk,
      philosophical Turk though he was. As for Blaise and Babette, the song says
      they suffer fond regrets that go on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why speak of Pierrot and Scapin? You know as well as I do they were
      scamps, and got their ears pulled more than once. No! glory costs too
      dear, even Harlequin&rsquo;s. On the contrary, it is very agreeable to be little
      boys and girls, and have the look of being great personages. That is why
      there is no pleasure to compare with a fancy ball, when the dresses are
      splendid enough. Only to wear them makes you feel brave. Then think how
      proud and pretty all your little friends are with their feathers and
      mantles; how gallant and gay and noble they look, and how like the fine
      folks of olden times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gallery, where you cannot see them, the musicians, with sad, gentle
      faces, are tuning up their fiddles. A stately quadrille lies open on their
      stands. They are going to attack the old-fashioned piece. At the first
      notes our heroes and masks will lead off the dance.

      I PROCLAIM Mademoiselle Genseigne&rsquo;s school the best girls&rsquo; school in the
      world. I declare miscreants and slanderers any who shall think or say the
      contrary. Mademoiselle Genseigne&rsquo;s pupils are all well-behaved and
      industrious, and there is no pleasanter sight to see than all their small
      figures sitting so still, and all the heads in a straight row. They look
      like so many little bottles into which Mademoiselle Gen-seigne is busy
      pouring useful knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Genseigne sits very upright at her high desk. She has a
      gentle, serious face; her neatly braided hair and her black tippet inspire
      respect and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Genseigne, who is very clever, is teaching her little pupils
      cyphering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She says to Rose Benoit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose Benoit, if I take four from twelve, what have I left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four?&rdquo; answers Rose Benoît.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Genseigne is not satisfied with the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Emmeline Capel, if I take four from twelve, how much have I
      left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight,&rdquo; Emmeline Capel answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, Rose Benoît, I have eight left,&rdquo; insists Mademoiselle
      Genseigne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose Benoît falls into a brown study. Mademoiselle Genseigne has eight
      left, she is told, but she has no notion if it is eight hats or eight
      handkerchiefs, or possibly eight apples or eight feathers. The doubt has
      long tormented her. She can make nothing of arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, she is very wise in Scripture History. Mademoiselle
      Genseigne has not another pupil who can describe the Garden of Eden or
      Noah&rsquo;s Ark as Rose Benoît can. Rose Benoît knows every flower in the
      Garden and all the animals in the Ark. She knows as many fairy tales as
      Mademoiselle Genseigne herself. She knows all the fables of the Fox and
      the Crow, the Donkey and the Little Dog, the Cock and the Hen, and what
      they said to each other. She is not at all surprised to hear that the
      animals used once to talk. The wonder would be if some one told her they
      don&rsquo;t talk now. She is quite sure she understands what her big dog Tom
      says and her little canary Chirp. She is quite right; animals have always
      talked, and they talk still; but they only talk to their friends. Rose
      Benoît loves them and they love her, and that is why she understands what
      they say. To understand each other there is nothing like loving one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day Rose Benoît has said her lessons without a mistake. She has won a
      good mark. Emmeline Capel has a good mark, too, for knowing her arithmetic
      lesson so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming out of school, she told her mother she had a good mark. Then she
      asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good mark, mother, what&rsquo;s the use of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good mark is of no use,&rdquo; Emmeline&rsquo;s mother answered; &ldquo;that is the very
      reason why we should be proud to get one. You will find out one day, my
      child, that the rewards most highly esteemed are just those that bring
      honour without profit.&rdquo;

      LITTLE girls long to pluck flowers and stars&mdash;it is their nature to.
      But stars will not be plucked, and the lesson they teach little girls is,
      that in this world there are longings that are never satisfied.
      Mademoiselle Marie has gone into the park, where she came upon a bed of
      hydrangeas; she saw how pretty the flowers were and that made her gather
      one. It was very difficult; she dragged with both hands, and very nearly
      tumbled over backwards when the stalk broke. She is pleased and proud at
      what she has done. But nurse has seen her. She runs up, snatches at
      Mademoiselle Marie&rsquo;s arm, scolds her, and sets her to stand and repent,
      not in the black closet, but at the foot of a great chestnut, under the
      shade of a huge Japanese umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Mademoiselle Marie sits and thinks, in great surprise and
      perplexity. Her flower in one hand and the umbrella making a bright halo
      round her, she looks like a little idol from overseas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nurse has told her: &ldquo;Marie, you must not put that flower in your mouth. If
      you do it when I tell you not, your little dog Toto will come and eat up
      your ears.&rdquo; And with these terrible words she walks away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young culprit, sitting quite still under her brilliant canopy, looks
      about her and gazes at earth and sky. It is a big world she sees, big
      enough and beautiful enough to amuse a little girl for some while. But her
      hydrangea blossom is more interesting than all the rest put together. She
      thinks to herself: &ldquo;It is a flower; it must smell good?&rdquo; And she puts her
      nose to the pretty pink and blue ball; she sniffs, but she cannot smell
      anything. She is not very good at scenting perfume; it is only a short
      while since she always used to blow at a rose instead of inhaling its
      odour. You must not laugh at her for that; one cannot learn everything at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, if she had as keen a sense of smell as her mother, she would be
      no better off in this case. A hydrangea <i>has</i> no scent; that is why
      we get tired of it, for all its loveliness. But now Mademoiselle Marie
      begins to think: &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s made of sugar, this flower.&rdquo; Then she opens
      her mouth very wide and is just going to lift the flower to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly, <i>yap!</i> goes her little dog. It is Toto, who comes
      bounding over a geranium bed and comes to a stand right in front of
      Mademoiselle Marie, with his ears cocked straight up, and stares hard at
      her out of his sharp little round eyes.

      THREE children of the same village, Pierre, Jacques, and Jean, stand
      staring, side by side in a row, where they look for all the world like a
      mouth-organ or Pandean Pipes, only with three pipes instead of seven.
      Pierre, to the left, is a tall lad; Jean, to the right, is a short child;
      Jacques, who is betwixt the two, may call himself tall <i>or</i> short,
      according as he looks at his left-hand or his right-hand neighbour. It is
      a situation I would beg you to ponder, for it is your own, and mine, and
      everybody else&rsquo;s. Each one of us is just like Jacques, and deems himself
      great or small according as his neighbours&rsquo; inches are many or few.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the reason why it is true to say that Jacques is neither tall nor
      short, and why it is also true to say he is tall <i>and</i> he is short.
      He is what God chooses him to be. For us, he is the middle reed of our
      living Pandean Pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is he doing, and what are his two comrades doing? They are
      staring, staring hard, all three. What at? At something that has
      disappeared in the distance, something that has vanished out of sight; yet
      they can see it still, and their eyes are dazzled with its splendours. It
      makes little Jean clean forget his eel-skin whiplash and the peg-top he
      has always been so fond of keeping for ever spinning with it in the dusty
      roads. Pierre and Jacques stand stolidly, their hands behind their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the wonderful sight that has bewildered all three? A pedlar&rsquo;s
      cart, a handcart; they had seen it stop in the village street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the pedlar drew back his oil-cloth covering, and all, men, women, and
      children, feasted their eyes on knives, scissors, popguns, jumping Jacks,
      wooden soldiers and lead soldiers, bottles of scent, cakes of soap,
      coloured pictures, and a thousand other splendid objects. The
      servant-wenches from the farm and the mill turned pale with longing;
      Pierre and Jacques flushed red with delight. Little Jean put out his
      tongue at it all. Everything the barrow held seemed to them rich and rare.
      But what they coveted most of all were those mysterious articles whose
      meaning and use they could make nothing of. For instance, there were
      polished globes like mirrors that reflected their feces with the features
      ludicrously distorted. There were Epinal wares with figures in impossibly
      vivid colours; there were little cases and boxes with nobody knows what
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women made purchases of muslins and laces by the yard, and the pedlar
      rolled the black oil-cloth cover back again over the treasures of his
      barrow. Then, pulling at the collar, he hauled off his load after him
      along the highroad. And now barrow and barrow-man have disappeared below
      the horizon.

    </div>
    <p>
      IT is a great anxiety keeping a stud. The horse is a delicate animal and
      needs a lot of looking after. Just ask Roger if it does n&rsquo;t!
    </p>
    <p>
      He is busy now grooming his noble chestnut, which would be the pearl of
      wooden horses, the flower of the Black Forest stud-farms, if only he had
      not lost half his tail in battle. Roger would so like to know whether
      wooden horses&rsquo; tails grow again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After rubbing them down in fancy, Roger gives his horses an imaginary feed
      of oats. That is the proper way to feed these elfin creatures of wood on
      whose backs little boys gallop through the land of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Roger is off for his ride, mounted on his mettled charger. The poor
      beast has no ears left and his mane is all notched like an old broken
      comb; but Roger loves him. Why it would be hard to say! This bay was the
      gift of a poor man; and the presents of the poor are somehow sweeter
      perhaps than any others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger is off. He has ridden far. The flowers of the carpet are the
      blossoms of the tropical forest. Good luck to you, little Roger! May your
      hobby-horse carry you happily through the world! May you never have a more
      dangerous mount! Small and great, we all ride ours! Which of us has not
      his hobby?
    </p>
    <p>
      Men&rsquo;s hobbies gallop like mad things along the roads of life; one is
      chasing glory, another pleasure; many leap over precipices and break their
      rider&rsquo;s neck. I wish you luck, little Roger, and I hope, when you are a
      man, you will bestride two hobbies that will always carry you along the
      right road; one is spirited, the other gentle-tempered; they are both
      noble steeds; one is called Courage and the other Kindness.

      LOUISON and Frédéric are off to school along the village street. The sun
      shines gaily and the two children are singing. They sing like the
      nightingale, because their hearts are light like his. They sing an old
      song their grandmothers sang when they were little girls, a song their
      children&rsquo;s children will sing one day; for songs are tender flowers that
      never die, they fly from lip to lip down the ages. The lips fade and fall
      silent one after the other, but the song lives on for ever. There are
      songs come down to us from the days when the men were shepherds and all
      the women shepherdesses. That is the reason why they speak of nothing but
      sheep and wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louison and Frédéric sing; their mouths are as round as a flower and the
      song rises shrill and thin and clear in the morning air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But listen! suddenly the notes stick in Frederic&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      What unseen power is it has strangled the music on the boy&rsquo;s lips? It is
      fear. Every day, as sure as fate, he comes upon the butcher&rsquo;s dog at the
      end of the village street, and every day his heart seems to stop and his
      legs begin to shake at the sight. Yet the butcher&rsquo;s dog does not fly at
      him, or even threaten to. He sits peaceably at his master&rsquo;s shop-door. But
      he is black, and he has a staring bloodshot eye and shows a row of sharp
      white teeth. He looks frightful. And then he squats there in the middle of
      bits of meat and offal and all sorts of horrors&mdash;which makes him more
      terrifying still. Of course it is n&rsquo;t his fault, but he is the presiding
      genius. Yes, a savage brute, the butcher&rsquo;s dog! So, the instant Frédéric
      catches sight of the beast before the shop, he picks up a big stone, as he
      sees grown-up men do to keep off bad-tempered curs, and he slinks past
      close, close under the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is how he behaved this time; and Louison laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not make any of those daredevil speeches one generally caps with
      others more reckless still. No, she never said a word; she never stopped
      singing. But she altered her voice and began singing on such a mocking
      note that Frédéric reddened to his very ears. Then his little head began
      to buzz with many thoughts. He learned that we must dread shame even more
      than danger. And he was afraid of being afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when school was over and he saw the butcher&rsquo;s dog, he marched
      undauntedly past the astonished animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      History adds that he kept a corner of his eye on Louison to see if she was
      looking. It is a true saying that, if there were no dames nor damsels in
      the world, men would be less courageous.

      IT is five o&rsquo;clock. Mademoiselle Catherine is &ldquo;at home&rdquo; to her dolls. It
      is her &ldquo;day.&rdquo; The dolls do not talk; the little Genie that gave them their
      smile did not vouchsafe the gift of speech. He refused it for the general
      good; if dolls could talk, we should hear nobody but them. Still there is
      no lack of conversation. Mademoiselle Catherine talks for her guests as
      well as for herself; she asks questions and gives the answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&mdash;Very well, thank you. I broke my arm yesterday
      morning going to buy cakes. But it&rsquo;s quite well now.&mdash;Ah! so much the
      better.&mdash;And how is your little girl?&mdash;She has the
      whooping-cough.&mdash;Ah! what a pity! Does she cough much?&mdash;Oh! no,
      it &lsquo;s a whooping-cough where there&rsquo;s no cough. You know I had two more
      children last week.&mdash;Really? that makes four doesn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;Four
      or five, I&rsquo;ve forgotten which. When you have so many, you get confused.&mdash;What
      a pretty frock you have.&mdash;Oh! I &lsquo;ve got far prettier ones still at
      home.&mdash;Do you go to the theatre?&mdash;Yes, every evening. I was at
      the Opera yesterday; but Polichinelle wasn&rsquo;t playing, because the wolf had
      eaten him.&mdash;I go to dances every day, my dear.&mdash;It is so
      amusing.&mdash;Yes, I wear a blue gown and dance with the young men,
      Generals, Princes, Confectioners, all the most distinguished people.&mdash;You
      look as pretty as an angel to-day, my dear.&mdash;Oh! it&rsquo;s the spring.&mdash;Yes,
      but what a pity it&rsquo;s snowing.&mdash;<i>I</i> love the snow, because it&rsquo;s
      white.&mdash;Oh! there&rsquo;s black snow, you know.&mdash;Yes, but that&rsquo;s the
      bad snow.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s fine conversation for you; Mademoiselle Catherine&rsquo;s
      tongue goes nineteen to the dozen. Still I have one fault to find with
      her; she talks all the time to the same visitor, who is pretty and wears a
      fine frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she is wrong. A good hostess is equally gracious to all her guests.
      She treats them all with affability, and if she shows any particular
      preference, it is to the more retiring and the less prosperous. We should
      flatter the unhappy; it is the only flattery allowable. But Catherine has
      discovered this for herself. She has guessed the secret of true
      politeness: a kind heart is everything. She pours out tea for the company,
      and forgets nobody. On the contrary, she presses the dolls that are poor
      and unhappy and shy to help themselves to invisible cakes and sandwiches

      THEY are sailor boys, regular little sea-dogs. Look at them; they have
      their caps pulled down over their ears so that the gale blowing in from
      the sea and bringing the spindrift with it may not deafen them with its
      dreadful howling. They wear heavy woollen clothes to keep out the cold and
      wet. Their patched pea-jacket and breeches have been their elders&rsquo; before
      them. Most of their garments have been contrived out of old things of
      their father&rsquo;s. Their soul is likewise of the same stuff as their
      father&rsquo;s; it is simple, brave, and long-suffering. At birth they inherited
      a single-hearted, noble temper. Who and what gave it them? After God and
      their parents, the Sea. The Sea teaches sailors courage by teaching them
      to face danger. It is a rough but kindly instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why our little sailor-boys, though their hearts are childlike
      still, have the spirit of gallant veterans. Elbows on the parapet of the
      sea-wall, they gaze out into the offing. It is more than the blue line
      marking the faint division between sea and sky that they see. Their eyes
      care little for the soft, changing colours of the ocean or the vast,
      contorted masses of the clouds. What they see, as they look seawards, is
      something more moving than the hue of the waves or the shape of the
      clouds; it is a suggestion of human love. They are spying for the boats
      that sailed away for the fishing; presently they will loom again on the
      horizon, laden with shrimp to the gunwales, and bringing home uncles and
      big brothers and fathers. The little fleet will soon appear yonder betwixt
      the ocean and God&rsquo;s sky with its white or brown sails. To-day the sky is
      unclouded, the sea calm; the flood tide floats the fishers gently to the
      shore. But the Ocean is a capricious old fellow, who takes all shapes and
      sings in many voices. To-day he laughs; to-morrow he will be growling in
      the night under his beard of foam. He shipwrecks the most handy boats,
      though they have been blessed by the Priest to the chanting of the <i>Te
      Deum</i>; he drowns the most skilful master mariners, and it is all his
      fault you see in the village, before the cottage doors where the nets hang
      to dry beside the fish-creels, so many women wearing black widow&rsquo;s weeds.

      GERMAINE is ill. Nobody knows how it began. The arm which sows fever is
      invisible like the dustman&rsquo;s hand, the old fellow who comes every night
      and makes the little ones so sleepy. But Germaine was not ill very long
      and she was not very bad, and now she is getting well again. This getting
      well is even pleasanter than being quite well, which comes next. In the
      same way hoping and wishing are better, very often, than anything we wish
      for or hope for. Germaine lies in bed in her pretty, bright room, and her
      dreams are as bright-coloured as her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looks, a little languidly still, at her doll, which sleeps beside her
      own bed. There are sympathies that go deep between little girls and their
      dolls. Germaine&rsquo;s doll fell ill at the same time as her little mamma, and
      now she is getting well with her. She will take her first carriage outing
      sitting by Germaine&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has seen the doctor too. Alfred came to feel the doll&rsquo;s pulse. He is
      Doctor &ldquo;As-bad-as-can-be.&rdquo; He talks of nothing but cutting off arms and
      legs. But Germaine asked him so earnestly that he agreed to cure her dolly
      without slashing it to pieces. But he prescribed the nastiest medicines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Illness has one advantage at any rate; it makes us know our friends.
      Germaine is sure now she can count on Alfred&rsquo;s goodness; she is certain
      Lucie is the best of sisters. All the nine days her illness lasted, Lucie
      came to learn her lessons and do her sewing in the sick room. She insists
      on bringing the little patient her herb-tea herself. And it is not a
      bitter potion, such as Alfred ordered; no, it is balmy with the scent of
      wild flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she smells its perfume, Germaine&rsquo;s thoughts fly to the flowery
      mountain paths, the haunt of children and bees, where she played so often
      last year. Alfred too remembers the beautiful ways, and the woods, and the
      springs, and the mules that climbed up and up on the brink of precipices
      with a sound of tinkling bells.

      ACROSS THE MEADOWS

    <p>
      AFTER breakfast Catherine! started off to the meadows with her little
      brother Jean. When they set out, the day seemed as young and fresh as they
      were. The sky was not altogether blue; it was grey rather, but of a
      tenderer grey than any blue. Catherine&rsquo;s eyes are just the same grey, as
      if made out of a bit of morning sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine and Jean wander all by themselves through the fields. Their
      mother is a farmer&rsquo;s wife and is at work at home. They have no nurse-maid
      to take them, and they don&rsquo;t need one. They know their way, and all the
      woods and fields and hills. Catherine can tell the time by looking at the
      sun, and she has guessed all sorts of pretty secrets of Nature that
      town-bred children have no suspicion of. Little Jean himself understands a
      great many things about the woods, the pools, and the mountains, for his
      little soul is a country soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine and Jean go roaming through the flowery meadows. As they go,
      Catherine gathers a nosegay. She picks blue centauries, scarlet poppies,
      cuckoo-flowers, and buttercups, which she also knows as <i>little chicks</i>.
      She picks those pretty purple blossoms that grow in hedgerows and are
      called Venus&rsquo; looking-glasses. She picks the dark ears of the milkwort,
      and crane&rsquo;s-bill and lily of the valley, whose tiny white bells shed a
      delicious perfume at the least puff of wind. Catherine loves flowers
      because they are beautiful; and she loves them too because they make such
      pretty ornaments. She is very simply dressed, and her pretty hair is hid
      under a brown linen cap. She wears a cotton check pinafore over her plain
      frock, and goes in wooden shoes. She has never seen rich dresses except on
      the Virgin Mary and the St. Catherine in the parish church. But there are
      some things little girls know directly they are born. Catherine knows that
      flowers are becoming to wear, and that pretty ladies who pin nosegays in
      their bosoms look lovelier than ever. So she has a notion she must be very
      fine indeed now, carrying a nosegay bigger than her own head. Her thoughts
      are as bright and fragrant as her flowers. They are thoughts that cannot
      be put into words; there are no words pretty enough. It wants song tunes
      for that, the liveliest and softest airs, the sweetest songs. So Catherine
      sings, as she gathers her nosegay: &ldquo;Away to the woods alone&rdquo; and &ldquo;My heart
      is for him, my heart is for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Jean is of another temper. He follows another line of ideas. He is
      a broth of a boy, he is; Jean is not breeched yet, but his spirit is
      beyond his years and there&rsquo;s no more rollicking blade than he. While he
      grips his sister&rsquo;s pinafore with one hand, for fear of tumbling, he shakes
      his whip in the other like a sturdy lad. His father&rsquo;s head stableman can
      hardly crack his any better when he meets his sweetheart, bringing home
      the horses from watering at the river. Little Jean is lulled by no soft
      reveries. He never heeds the field flowers. The games he dreams of are
      stiff jobs of work. His thoughts dwell on wagons stogged in the mire and
      big carthorses hauling at the collar at his voice and under his lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine and Jean have climbed above the meadows, up the hill, to a high
      ground from which you can make out all the chimneys of the village dotted
      among the trees and in the far distance the steeples of six parishes. Then
      you see what a big place the world is. Then Catherine can better
      understand the stories she has been taught,&mdash;the dove from the Ark,
      the Israelites in the Promised Land, and Jesus going from city to city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down there,&rdquo; she says.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down she sits, and, opening her hands, she sheds her flowery harvest all
      over her. She is all fragrant with blossoms, and in a moment the
      butterflies come fluttering round her. She picks and chooses and matches
      her flowers; she weaves them into garlands and wreaths, and hangs
      flower-bells in her ears; she is decked out now like the rustic image of a
      Holy Virgin the shepherds venerate. Her little brother Jean, who has been
      busy all this while driving a team of imaginary horses, sees her in all
      this bravery. Instantly he is filled with admiration. A religious awe
      penetrates all his childish soul. He stops, and the whip falls from his
      fingers. He feels that she is beautiful and all smothered in lovely
      flowers. He tries in vain to say all this in his soft, indistinct speech.
      But she has guessed. Little Catherine is his big sister, and a big sister
      is a little mother; she foresees, she guesses; she has the sacred
      instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling,&rdquo; cries Catherine, &ldquo;I am going to make you a beautiful
      wreath, and you will look like a little king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so she twines together the white flowers, the yellow flowers, and the
      red flowers, into a chaplet. She puts it on little Jean&rsquo;s head, and he
      flushes with pride and pleasure. She kisses her little brother, lifts him
      in her arms and plants him, all garlanded with blossoms, on a big stone.
      Then she looks at him admiringly, because he is beautiful and <i>she</i>
      has made him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      And standing there on his rustic pedestal, little Jean knows he is
      beautiful, and the thought fills him with a deep respect for himself. He
      feels he is something holy. Very upright and still, with round eyes and
      tight-drawn lips, arms by his side with the palms open and the fingers
      parted like the spokes of a wheel, he tastes a pious joy to be an idol&mdash;he
      is sure he is an idol now. The sky is overhead, the woods and fields lie
      at his feet. He is the hub of the universe. He alone is great, he alone is
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly Catherine breaks into a laugh. She shouts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how funny you look, little Jean! how funny you do look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She runs up and throws her arms round him, she kisses him and shakes him;
      the heavy wreath of flowers slips down over his nose. And she laughs
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how funny he looks! how very funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it is no laughing matter for little Jean. He is sad and sorry,
      wondering why it is all over and he has left off being beautiful. It hurts
      to come down to earth again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the wreath is unwound and tossed on the grass, and little Jean is like
      anybody else once more. Yes, he has left off being beautiful. But he is
      still a sturdy young scamp. He soon has his whip in hand again and now he
      is hauling his team of six, the six big carthorses of his dreams, out of
      that rut. Catherine is still playing with her flowers. But some of them
      are dying. Others are closing in sleep. For the flowers go to sleep like
      the animals, and look! the campanulas, plucked a few hours ago, are
      shutting their purple bells and sinking asleep in the little hands that
      have parted them from life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light breeze blows by, and Catherine shivers. It is night coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; says little Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Catherine has not a bit of bread to give her little brother. She says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little brother, let &lsquo;s go back to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they both think of the cabbage soup steaming in the pot that hangs
      from the hook right under the great chimney. Catherine gathers her flowers
      in her arm and taking her little brother by the hand, she leads him
      homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun sank slowly down to the ruddy West. The swallows swooped past the
      two children, almost touching them with their wings, that hardly seemed to
      move. It was getting dark. Catherine and Jean pressed closer together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine dropped her flowers one after the other by the way. They could
      hear, in the wide silence, the untiring chirp-chirp of the crickets. They
      were afraid, both of them, and they were sad; the melancholy of nightfall
      had entered into their little hearts. All round them was familiar ground,
      but the things they knew the best looked strange and uncanny. The earth
      seemed suddenly to have grown too big and too old for them. They were
      tired, and they began to think they would never reach the house, where
      mother was making the soup for all the family. Jean&rsquo;s whip hung limp and
      still, and Catherine let the last of her flowers slip from her tired
      fingers. She was dragging Jean along by the arm, and neither said a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they saw a long way off the roof of their house and smoke rising
      in the darkening sky. Then they stopped running, and clapping their hands
      together, shouted for joy. Catherine kissed her little brother; then they
      set off running again as fast as ever their weary legs would carry them.
      When they reached the village, there were women coming back from the
      fields who gave them good evening. They breathed again. Their mother was
      on the door-step, in a white cap, soup-ladle in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, little ones, come along!&rdquo; she called to them. And they threw
      themselves into her arms. When she reached the parlour where the cabbage
      soup was smoking on the table, Catherine shivered again. She had seen
      night come down over the earth. Jean, seated on the settle, his chin on a
      level with the table, was already eating his soup.

      RENÉ, Bernard, Roger, Jacques, and Etienne feel sure there is nothing
      finer in the world than to be a soldier. Francine agrees with them and she
      would love to be a boy to join the army. They think so because soldiers
      wear fine uniforms, epaulettes and gold lace, and glittering swords. There
      is yet another reason for putting the soldier in the front rank of
      citizens&mdash;because he gives his life for his Country. There is no true
      greatness in this world but that of sacrifice, and to offer one&rsquo;s life is
      the greatest of all sacrifices, because it includes all others. That is
      why the hearts of the crowd beat high when a regiment goes by.
    </p>
    <p>
      René is the General. He wears a cocked hat and rides a war-horse. The hat
      is made of paper and the horse is a chair. His army consists of a drummer
      and four men&mdash;of whom one is a girl! &ldquo;Shoulder arms! Forward, march!&rdquo;
       and the march past begins. Francine and Roger look quite imposing under
      arms. True, Jacques does not hold his gun very valiantly. He is a
      melancholy lad. But we must not blame him for that; dreamers can be just
      as brave as those who never dream at all. His little brother Etienne, the
      tiniest mite in the regiment, looks pensive. He is ambitious; he would
      like to be a general officer right away, and that makes him sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward! forward!&rdquo; René shouts the order. &ldquo;We are to fall on the Chinese,
      who are in the dining-room.&rdquo; The Chinese are chairs. When you play at
      fighting, chairs make first-rate Chinese. They fall&mdash;and what better
      can the Chinese do? When all the chairs are feet in air, René announces:
      &ldquo;Soldiers, now we have beaten the Chinese, we will have our rations.&rdquo; The
      idea is well received on all hands. Yes, soldiers must eat. This time the
      Commissariat has furnished the best of victuals&mdash;buns, maids of
      honour, coffee cakes and chocolate cakes, red-currant syrup. The army
      falls to with a will. Only Etienne will eat nothing. He frowns and looks
      enviously at the sword and cocked hat which the General has left on a
      chair. He creeps up, snatches them, and slips into the next room. There he
      stands alone before the glass; he puts on the cocked hat and waves the
      sword; he is a general, a general without an army, a general all to
      himself. He tastes the pleasures of ambition&mdash;pleasures full of vague
      forecastings and long, long hopes.

    <p>
      AUTUMN is here. The wind blowing through the woods whirls about the dead
      leaves. The chestnuts are stripped bare already and lift their black
      skeleton arms in the air. And now the beeches and hornbeams are shedding
      <i>their</i> leaves. The birches and aspens are turned to trees of gold,
      and only the great oak keeps his coronal of green.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning is fresh; a keen wind is chasing the clouds across a grey sky
      and reddening the youngsters&rsquo; fingers. Pierre, Babet, and Jeannot are off
      to collect the dead leaves, the leaves that once, when they were still
      alive, were full of dew and songs of birds, and which now strew the ground
      in thousands and thousands with their little shrivelled corpses. They are
      dead, but they smell good. They will make a fine litter for Riquette, the
      goat, and Roussette, the cow. Pierre has taken his big basket; he is quite
      a little man. Babet has her sack; she is quite a little woman. Jeannot
      comes last trundling the wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hill they go at a run. At the edge of the wood they find the
      other village children, who are come too to lay in a store of dead leaves
      for the winter. It is not play, this; it is work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But never think the children are sad, because they are at work. Work is
      serious, yes; it is not sad. Very often the little ones mimic it in fun,
      and children&rsquo;s games, most times, are copies of their elders&rsquo; workaday
      doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they are hard at it. The boys do their part in silence. They are
      peasant lads, and will soon be men, and peasants do not talk much. But it
      is different with the little peasant girls; <i>their</i> tongues go at a
      fine pace, as they fill the baskets and bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the sun is climbing higher and warming the country pleasantly.
      From the cottage roofs rise light puffs of smoke. The children know what
      that means. The smoke tells them the pease-soup is cooking in the pot. One
      more armful of dead leaves, and the little workers will take the road
      home. It is a stiff climb. Bending under sacks or toiling behind barrows,
      they soon get hot, and the sweat comes out in beads. Pierre, Babet and
      Jeannot stop to take breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the thought of the pease-soup keeps up their courage. Puffing and
      blowing, they reach home at last. Their mother is waiting for them on the
      door-step and calls out: &ldquo;Come along, children, the soup is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our little friends find this capital. There&rsquo;s no soup so good as what you
      have worked for.

      THE Louvre, as you know, is a museum where beautiful things and ancient
      things are kept safe&mdash;and this is wisely done, for old age and beauty
      are both alike venerable. Among the most touching of the antiquities
      treasured in the Louvre Museum is a fragment of marble, worn and cracked
      in many places, but on which can still be clearly made out two maidens
      holding each a flower in her hand. Both are beautiful figures; they were
      young when Greece was young. They say it was the age of perfect beauty.
      The sculptor who has left us their image represents them in profile,
      offering each other one of those lotus flowers that were deemed sacred. In
      the blue cups of their blossoms the world quaffed oblivion of the ills of
      life. Our men of learning have given much thought to these two maidens.
      They have turned over many books to find out about them, big books, bound
      some in parchment, others in vellum, and many in pig-skin; but they have
      never fathomed the reason why the two beautiful maidens hold up a flower
      in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      What they could not discover after so much labour and thought, so many
      arduous days and sleepless nights, Mademoiselle Suzanne knew in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her papa had taken her to the Louvre, where he had business. Mademoiselle
      Suzanne looked wonderingly at the antiques, and seeing gods with missing
      arms and legs and heads, she said to herself: &ldquo;Ah! yes, these are the
      grown-up gentlemen&rsquo;s dolls; I see now gentlemen break their dollies the
      same as little girls do.&rdquo; But when she came to the two maidens who, each
      of them, hold a flower, she threw them a kiss, because they looked so
      charming. Then her father asked her: &ldquo;Why do they give each other a
      flower?&rdquo; And Suzanne answered at once: &ldquo;To wish each other a happy
      birthday.&rdquo; Then, after thinking a moment, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have the same birthday; they are both alike and they are offering
      each other the same flower. Girl friends should always have the same
      birthday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Suzanne is far away from the Louvre and the old Greek marbles; she is
      in the kingdom of the birds and the flowers. She is spending the bright
      spring days in the meadows under shelter of the woods. She plays in the
      grass, and that is the sweetest sort of play. She remembers to-day is her
      little friend Jacqueline&rsquo;s birthday; and so she is going to pick flowers
      which she will give Jacqueline, and kiss her.

      JEAN set out betimes in the morning with his sister Jeanne, a fishing-pole
      over his shoulder and a basket on his arm. It is holiday time and the
      school is shut; that is why Jean goes off every day with his sister
      Jeanne, a rod over his shoulder and a basket on his arm, along the river
      bank. Jean is a Tourainer, and Jeanne a lass of Touraine. The river is
      Tourainer too. It runs crystal-clear between silvery sallows under a
      moist, mild sky. Morning and evening white mists trail over the grass of
      the water-meadows.&rsquo; But Jean and Jeanne love the river neither for the
      greenery of its banks nor its clear waters that mirror the heavens. They
      love it for the fish in it. They stop presently at the most likely place,
      and Jeanne sits down under a pollard willow. Laying down his baskets, Jean
      unwinds his tackle. This is very primitive&mdash;a switch, with a piece of
      thread and a bent pin at the end of it. Jean supplied the rod, Jeanne gave
      the line and the hook; so the tackle is the common property of brother and
      sister. Both want it all to themselves, and this simple contrivance, only
      meant to do mischief to the fishes, becomes the cause of domestic broils
      and a rain of blows by the peaceful riverside. Brother and sister fight
      for the free use of the rod and line. Jean&rsquo;s arm is black and blue with
      pinches and Jeanne&rsquo;s cheek scarlet from her brother&rsquo;s slaps. At last, when
      they were tired of pinching and hitting, Jean and Jeanne consented to
      share amicably what neither could appropriate by force. They agreed that
      the rod should pass alternately from the brother&rsquo;s hands to the sister&rsquo;s
      after each fish they caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean begins. But there&rsquo;s no knowing when he will end. He does not break
      the treaty openly, but he shirks its consequences by a mean trick. Rather
      than have to hand over the tackle to his sister, he refuses to catch the
      fish that come, when they nibble the bait and set his float bobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean is artful; Jeanne is patient. She has been waiting six hours. But at
      last she seems tired of doing nothing. She yawns, stretches, lies down in
      the shade of the willow, and shuts her eyes. Jean spies her out of one
      corner of his, and he thinks she is asleep. The float dives. He whips out
      the line, at the end of which gleams a flash of silver. A gudgeon has
      taken the pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s my turn now,&rdquo; cries a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jeanne snatches the rod.

      IT was to go and see their friend Jean that Roger, Marcel, Bernard,
      Jacques, and Etienne set out along the broad highroad that winds like a
      handsome yellow riband through the fields and meadows. Now they are off.
      They start all abreast; it is the best way. Only there is one defect in
      the arrangement this time; Etienne is too little to keep up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tries hard and puts his best foot foremost. His short legs stretch
      their widest. He swings his arms into the bargain. But he is too little;
      he cannot go as fast as his companions. He falls behind because he is too
      small; it is no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big boys, who are older, should surely wait for him, you say, and suit
      their pace to his. So they should, but they don&rsquo;t. Forward! cry the strong
      ones of this world, and they leave the weaklings in the lurch. But hear
      the end of the story. All of a sudden our four tall, strong, sturdy
      friends see something jumping on the ground. It jumps because it is a
      frog, and it wants to reach the meadow along the roadside. The meadow is
      froggy&rsquo;s home, and he loves it; he has his residence there beside a brook.
      He jumps, and jumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a green frog, and he looks like a leaf that is alive. Now the lads
      are in the meadow; very soon they feel their feet sinking in the soft
      ground where the rank grass grows. A few steps more, and they are up to
      their knees in mud. The grass hid a swamp underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      They just manage to struggle out. Shoes, socks, calves are all as black as
      ink. The fairy of the green field has put gaiters of mire on the four bad
      boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etienne comes up panting for breath. He hardly knows, when he sees them in
      this pickle, if he should be glad or sorry. His simple little heart is
      filled with a sense of the catastrophes that befall the great and strong.
      As for the four muddy urchins, they turn back piteously the way they came,
      for how can they, I should like to know, how can they go and see their
      friend Jean with their shoes and stockings in this state? When they get
      home again, their mothers will know how naughty they have been by the
      evidence of their legs, while little Etienne&rsquo;s innocence will be legible
      on his sturdy little stumps.

      A CHILD&rsquo;S DINNER PARTY

      WHAT fun it is playing at dinner parties! You can have a very plain dinner
      or a very elaborate one, just as you like. You can manage it with nothing
      at all. Only you have to pretend a great deal then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thérèse and her little sister Pauline have asked Pierre and Marthe to a
      dinner in the country. Proper invitations have been issued, and they have
      been talking about it for days. Mamma has given her two little girls good
      advice&mdash;and good things to eat, too. There will be nougat and sweet
      cakes, and a chocolate cream. The table will be laid in the arbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only it will be fine!&rdquo; cries Thérèse, who is nine now. At her age one
      knows the fondest hopes are often disappointed in this world and you
      cannot always do what you propose. But little Pauline has none of these
      worries. She cannot think it will be wet. It will be fine, because she
      wants it to.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lo! the great day has broken clear and sunny. Not a cloud in the sky.
      The two guests have come. How fortunate! For this was another subject of
      anxiety for Thérèse. Marthe had caught a cold, and perhaps she would not
      be better in time. As for little Pierre, everybody knows he always misses
      the train. You cannot blame him for it. It is his misfortune, not his
      fault. His mother is unpunctual by nature. Everywhere and always little
      Pierre arrives after everybody else; he has never in his life seen the
      beginning of anything. This has given him a dull, resigned look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner is served; ladies and gentlemen, take your places! Thérèse
      presides. She is thoughtful and serious; the housewifely instinct is
      awaking in her bosom. Pierre carves valiantly. Nose in the dish and elbows
      above his head, he struggles to divide the leg of a chicken. Why, his feet
      even take their part in the tremendous effort. Mademoiselle Marthe eats
      elegantly, without any ado or any noise, just like a grown-up lady.
      Pauline is not so particular; she eats how she can and as much as she can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thérèse, now serving her guests, now one of them herself, is content; and
      contentment is better than joy. The little dog Gyp has come to eat up the
      scraps, and Thérèse thinks, as she watches him crunching the bones, that
      dogs know nothing of all the dainty ways that make grown-up dinners, and
      children&rsquo;s too, so refined and delightful.
